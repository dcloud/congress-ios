## Issues and Feedback

Please report all issues on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/congress-ios/issues).

## Development

Congress for iOS uses [Crashlytics](https://crashlytics.com/), and [Sunlight API key](https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/). You'll need to register for these services. The app also uses [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com), so you'll need an access token for that as well.

1. Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) and `pod install`
1. `cp Other\ Sources/SFSettingsExample.h Other\ Sources/SFSettings.h`
1. `cp Other\ Sources/SFSettingsExample.m Other\ Sources/SFSettings.m`
1. Edit *Other Sources/SFSettings.m* to remove the *#error* line and set the appropriate constant values

That should be it. Build, run, and have at it.
